Haunted house: scratch project: Week 1 SOC

We were tasked with creating an Escape room via scratch! We had just over 1.5 days to complete the task. Above you can see three versions of our scratch game escape room final.sb3 is the final version. Our game is a Haunted house escape room based on Dracula's castle. It has a start screen with sound, amination, three individual escape rooms and an end screen. 
 
As a team of three we designated tasks, each having an individual room to create. Using the Disney ideation technique to plan. 
Our Dreamer stage:
Indiana jones
SFI and aliens
Pirates
Haunted house
Underwater




Realistic stage:
What version do we think would work:
Realistic 2-3 things to get out(mini games)
2D
Static backgrounds
We decided to stick to an individual escape room and theme.

Critics stage:
What are the risks:
Over estimated ability = were prepared to be flexible at any point in the creation (Agile working)
Time management = great communication on slack. Discussed how long we were prepared to work today. 
Overly complex idea = Pick simple and easy to make concepts for minigames.
Door open to enter the room may be difficult to code in the time
